# Quark-Engine
Quark is a high-performance and easy-to-use game engine built in C++. This repository contains examples and detailed breakdowns!

Builds for the examples can be found in [bin/](bin/) and code in [examples/](examples/).  

The wiki can be found [here](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki) and covers broad, technical information, as well as my thoughts on the project.

## Features
- High-performance forward renderer using Vulkan
- Material batching system using indirect draw calls
- Bitset-based entity component system
- GLSL language extension / transpiler
- Plugins using shared libraries
- GLSL-inspired math library

## Future Plans
- 1.0 version (currently 70% feature complete)
- Open source more systems as they get developed
- Make a commercial game to test the engine

##  Why Make a Game Engine?
I think game engine technology is interesting and I wanted to explore it more. I am also trying to continually improve my skills through new challenges. Making a game engine is a great way for me to do both!
