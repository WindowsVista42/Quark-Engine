# Quark-Engine
**Welcome!**

Quark is a high-performance and easy-to-use game engine built in C++. I have been developing Quark for the past year and have custom-built: a renderer using Vulkan, an entity component system, modding support, a draw-call batching system, open-sourced libraries, and much more!

This repository contains general information about the engine, a demo, and a wiki. The demo is a fully playable game showing what Quark can do, and the wiki covers broad, technical information. This repository acts as a way to showcase the engine while also cataloging my thoughts on the project.

## Features
- High-performance renderer using Vulkan
- Material batching system using indirect draw calls
- Bitset-based entity component system
- GLSL language extension / transpiler
- Plugins using shared libraries
- GLSL-inspired math library
- Simple "C-style" API
- CLI tooling
- Fast compile times
- Arena based memory management
- Open source thread pool implementation
- Open source package format
- **More details on the [wiki](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki)!**

## Examples
Showcase video explaining some of the high level features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleAUZQlFJ4

Source code for the examples can be found in [examples/](examples/).  
Builds for the examples can be found in [bin/](bin/).  

## Future Plans
- 1.0 version (currently 70% feature complete)
- Open source more systems as they get developed
- Make a commercial game to test the engine

##  Why Make a Game Engine?
I think game engine technology is interesting and I wanted to explore it more. I am also trying to continually improve my skills through new challenges. Making a game engine is a great way for me to do both!
