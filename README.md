# Quark-Engine
**Welcome!**

Quark is a high-performance and easy-to-use game engine built in C++. I have been developing Quark for the past year and have custom-built: a renderer using Vulkan, an entity component system, modding support, a draw-call batching system, open-sourced libraries, and much more!

This repository contains general information about the engine, a demo, and a wiki. The demo is a fully playable game showing what Quark can do, and the wiki covers broad, technical information. This repository acts as a way to showcase the engine while also cataloging my thoughts on the project.

## Features
- Written in C++
- Custom CLI tooling in Python
- Custom high-performance renderer using Vulkan
- Custom material system capable of one-draw-call per material type
- Custom bitset based entity component system
- GLSL language extension / transpiler
- Plugins / modding support
- Simple "C-style" API
- Optimized compile times
- Arena based memory management
- Open source thread pool implementation
- Open source package format
- **More details on the [wiki](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki)!**

## Demo
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleAUZQlFJ4

I have a demo of the engine in [SpaceshipsDemo/](SpaceshipsDemo/).  
There is a build of the game in [SpaceshipsDemo/build/](SpaceshipsDemo/build/).  
You can check out the code for the game in [SpaceshipsDemo/spaceships/](SpaceshipsDemo/spaceships/).  

**Note:** The code requires the engine to compile, but I provide a short breakdown so you know what to look at.  

## Future Plans
- 1.0 version (currently 70% feature complete)
- Open source more systems
- Make a commercial game to test the engine

##  Why Make a Game Engine?
I think game engine technology is interesting and I wanted to explore it more. I am also trying to continually improve my skills through new challenges. Making a game engine is a great way for me to do both.

## Open Sourced Parts
Open sourced libraries I have made for the engine can be found on the [**wiki**](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki/Open-Sourced-Libraries).

## Wiki
I go into more depth on the technical aspects of the engine on the [**wiki**](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki).
