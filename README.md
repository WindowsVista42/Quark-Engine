# Quark-Engine
Quark is a high-performance and easy-to-use game engine built in C++. This repository contains examples and detailed breakdowns!

Builds for the examples can be found in [bin/](bin/) and code in [examples/](examples/).  

The wiki can be found [here](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki) and covers broad, technical information, as well as my thoughts on the project.
