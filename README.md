# Quark-Engine
Quark is a game engine I have been developing for the past year. This repository covers what I have worked on so far.

<!-- TODO: add to this a little bit, just like a tiny amount -->

## Features
- Written in C++
- Custom CLI tooling in Python
- Custom high-performance renderer using Vulkan
- Custom material system capable of one-draw-call per material type
- Custom bitset based entity component system
- GLSL language extension / transpiler
- Plugins / modding support
- Simple "C-style" API
- Optimized compile times
- Arena based memory management
- Open source thread pool implementation
- Open source package format
- **More details on the [wiki](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki)!**

## Demo
I have a demo for the engine in the [SpaceshipsDemo](SpaceshipsDemo/) folder. Code is in the [SpaceshipsDemo/spaceships](SpaceshipsDemo/spaceships) folder, and a build is in the [SpaceshipsDemo/build](SpaceshipsDemo/build) folder. The code requires the engine to compile, but it's still useful here for showing how the engine works for users.

Also, here is a **quick video** showing the demo in action: <!-- TODO: --> [LINK TO SOME VIDEO]()

More details about the demo are on the [**wiki**](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki/Demo).

## Future Plans
- 1.0 version in the future
- Will open source more things as systems get developed
- Will test the engine by making games

##  Why Make a Game Engine?
I think game engine technology is interesting and I wanted to explore it more. I am also trying to continually improve my skills through new challenges. Making a game engine is a great way for me to do both.

## Wiki
I go into more depth on the technical aspects on the [**wiki**](https://github.com/WindowsVista42/Quark-Engine/wiki).
