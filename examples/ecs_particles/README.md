# ECS Particles
This example shows how you might create a particle system using the ECS in Quark. This example also saves game snapshots so reloading the example doesn't reset particle configurations.

The code is heavily commented to explain what everything does.

## Controls
- **WASD** - move around
- **SPACE/LEFT CONTROL** - move up/down
- **MOUSE** - look around
- **I/K** - move the selection up/down
- **U/J** - increase/decrease the selected value
- **ESCAPE** - close the program

## Build
A build is available in [bin/ecs_particles/](../../bin/ecs_particles/).

## Output
You can configure the parameters of the particle emitter, by default it looks like this:
